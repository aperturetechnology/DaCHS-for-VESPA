# DaCHS-for-VESPA

This directory contains:

 * [q.rd_examples](q.rd_examples)
 Examples of q.rd files defining actual data services in DaCHS. 


 * docker
 Early try at encapsulating DaCHS in a docker

 * qrdcreator1 (deprecated)
 * qrdcreator2 
 * qrd_generator.html 
 Helper to generate q.rd files from a web form
(Original note) Current task is to update q.rd generator:
 * to defind binds, especially for spatial_frame type (so it doesn't need so much tinkering for GAVO to ingest it)

 * mixin-EPN-TAP-1.0 (deprecated)
 * mixin-EPN-TAP-2.0 (deprecated)
 Older tries at EPN-TAP mixins - use the one from your DaCHS server

 * Scripts
 Early support routines for CRISM
