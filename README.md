# DaCHS-for-VESPA

This directory contains:

- Examples of q.rd files defining actual data services in DaCHS. 
	- [q.rd_examples](q.rd_examples)

- Early try at encapsulating DaCHS in a docker
	- docker

- Helper to generate q.rd files from a web form
	- qrdcreator1 (deprecated)
	- qrdcreator2 
	- qrd_generator.html 

(Original note) Current task is to update q.rd generator: to defind binds, especially for spatial_frame type (so it doesn't need so much tinkering for GAVO to ingest it)

- Older tries at EPN-TAP mixins - use the one from your DaCHS server
	- mixin-EPN-TAP-1.0 (deprecated)
	- mixin-EPN-TAP-2.0 (deprecated)

- Early support routines for CRISM
	- Scripts
