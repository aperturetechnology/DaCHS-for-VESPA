# SPICAM EPN-TAP v2 service with mixin

Configuration file for spicam service, can be used as templates and adapted.

   - q.rd builds the service from a csv file. Contains a datalink parameter calling the Mars Climate Database in the same conditions (with free parameter selecting the scenario in use). Datalink also provides a link to an ascii version of the files (while access_url provides a link to a VOTable version). Updated in December 2018 to fix small issues.
